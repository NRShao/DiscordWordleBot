You are the son of a motherless ogre.
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries.
I once owned a dog that was smarter than you. 
Go and boil your bottom! Son of a silly person! 
Go away or I shall taunt you a second time. 
Shouldn't you have a license for being that ugly?
Calling you an idiot would be an insult to all the stupid people.
Why don't you slip into something more comfortable...like a coma.
Well, they do say opposites attract...so I sincerely hope you meet somebody who is attractive, honest, intelligent, and cultured...
Yo momma so fat when she sits around the house she sits AROUND the house.
Up yours, meatbag.
Why don't you go outside and play hide and go fuck yourself!
You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity.
The things you've said are the most insanely idiotic things I've ever heard. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to you speak. May God have mercy on your soul.
Look up Idiot in the dictionary. Know what you'll find? The definition of the word IDIOT, which is you.
If I had a dick this is when I'd tell you to suck it.
Go play in traffic.
The village called, they want their idiot back.
You smell bad!
I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, a stinking snotrag, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention that you smell?
You have such wild delusions of adequacy.
People only follow what you do out of morbid curiosity.
You have such low personal standards and still fail to meet them.
You should go far. Far away from everyone.
I would not allow you to breed.
You have hit rock bottom and clearly show signs of digging.
