You are the son of a motherless ogre.
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries.
I once owned a dog that was smarter than you. 
Go and boil your bottom! Son of a silly person! 
Go away or I shall taunt you a second time. 
Shouldn't you have a license for being that ugly?
Calling you an idiot would be an insult to all the stupid people.
Why don't you slip into something more comfortable...like a coma.
Well, they do say opposites attract...so I sincerely hope you meet somebody who is attractive, honest, intelligent, and cultured...
Yo momma so fat when she sits around the house she sits AROUND the house.
Up yours, meatbag.
Why don't you go outside and play hide and go fuck yourself!
You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity.
What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I've ever heard. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. May God have mercy on your soul.
Look up Idiot in the dictionary. Know what you'll find? The definition of the word IDIOT, which is you.
If I had a dick this is when I'd tell you to suck it.
Go play in traffic.
The village called, they want their idiot back.
You smell bad!
